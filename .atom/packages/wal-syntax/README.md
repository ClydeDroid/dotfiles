# wal-syntax theme

A simple theme meant for having its colors.less replaced by dylanaraps/pywal.

Copy this directory into your `.atom/packages`, and then run `setwall` with your
preferred wallpaper. Finally, change your syntax theme in the Atom settings to
"Wal", and voila, your syntax theme should match your terminal colors!
